    /// PURPOSE:
    /// These tests verify that the UIManager correctly initializes UI panels, responds to 
    /// game events, and handles UI state transitions. Unlike EditMode tests, these PlayMode 
    /// tests can validate the actual GameObject hierarchy and UI rendering.
    ///
    /// MOTIVATION:
    /// The UI system is the primary way players interact with the game. These tests help ensure
    /// that the UI is properly constructed and functions correctly. Since UI issues directly 
    /// affect user experience, it's critical to verify the UI panels are created and behave
    /// as expected.
